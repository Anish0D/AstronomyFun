# AstronomyFun

I'll be applying my coding knowledge to Astronomy-related subjects, and having fun while doing it.

I am using a smaller version of the Galaxy10 dataset with 1000 images to train my CNN. (Galaxy10_small.h5)

The goal is to create a Neural Network that can identify the specific type of galaxy when provided an image of any galaxy.
